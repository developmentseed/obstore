The simplest, highest-throughput [^1] Python interface to [S3][s3], [GCS][gcs], [Azure Storage][azure_storage], & other S3-compliant APIs, powered by Rust.

- Sync and async API with **full type hinting**.
- **Streaming downloads** with configurable chunking.
- **Streaming uploads** from files or async or sync iterators.
- **Streaming list**, with no need to paginate.
- Automatic [**multipart uploads**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html) for large file objects.
- Support for **conditional put** ("put if not exists"), as well as custom tags and attributes.
- Optionally return list results in [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) format, which is faster and more memory-efficient than materializing Python `dict`s.
- File-like object API and [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec) integration.
- Easy to install with no required Python dependencies.
- The [underlying Rust library](https://docs.rs/object_store) is production quality and used in large scale production systems, such as the Rust package registry [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
- Zero-copy data exchange between Rust and Python via the [buffer protocol](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/05/introduction-to-the-python-buffer-protocol/).

<!-- For Rust developers looking to add object_store support to their Python packages, refer to pyo3-object_store. -->

[^1]: Benchmarking is currently ongoing, but [early results](https://github.com/geospatial-jeff/pyasyncio-benchmark/blob/2d8ee4df8c2d93463323394f09fd094ad0381122/test_results/cog_header_results.csv) indicate 9x higher throughput than aioboto3 and fsspec.
