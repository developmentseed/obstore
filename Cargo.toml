# Note: pyo3-object_store is _not_ a member of this workspace because we need to
# patch the object_store version for Python to export a list stream. This list
# stream is implemented in https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/6619 and will
# be included in object_store's next major release.
#
# But pyo3-object_store gets published to crates.io, which can't have git
# dependencies.
